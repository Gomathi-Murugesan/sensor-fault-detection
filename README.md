# Sensor Fault Detection

The Air Pressure System(APS) is a critical part in heavy-duty vehicles like trucks. It uses comparessed air to force a piston inorder to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. 
```
This is a Binary Classification problem, in which positive class indicates that the failure was caused by components of APS and negative class indicates that the failure was not caused by APS(caused by someother components in the vehicle)
